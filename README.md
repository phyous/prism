# Prism

Prism is a productivity app for Android focused on daily improvement and personal accountability. Do better in your work & personal life by building a habit of self-reflection.

<b>Here's how to play:</b><br/>
➢ At the end of every day you'll get a reminder to grade yourself (Default time is 10PM but you can change this in settings)<br/>
➢ Reflect on what you did well during the day<br/>
➢ Reflect on what you feel you could have done better<br/>
➢ Pick 3 things to focus on for tomorrow<br/>

If you interested in making improvements just send me a pull request.
